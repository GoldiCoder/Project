<h1>We dream to remember.</h1>
<h3> <ul>
<li>To increase performance on certain mental tasks, sleep is good, 
but dreaming while sleeping is better.</li> 
<li> In 2010, researchers found that subjects were much better at getting through a complex 3-D maze 
if they had napped and dreamed of the maze prior to their second attempt. 
In fact, they were upto ten times better at it, than those who only thought of 
the maze while awake between attempts, and those who napped but did not dream about the maze. </li>
<li>Researchers theorize that certain memory processes, can happen only when we are asleep, 
and our dreams are a signal that these processes are taking place.</li></ul></h3>
