<h1>We dream to keep our brains working.
</h1>
<h3> <ul> 
<li>The <a href= "c.act.the.html">continual activation theory</a> proposes that your dreams result from your brain&apos;s 
need to constantly consolidate and create long-term memories in order to function properly. </li>
 <li>So, when external input falls below a certain level like when you&apos;re asleep, your brain automatically 
 triggers the generation of data from its memory storages, which appear to you in the form of the thought and feelings
 you experience in your dreams.</li>
 <li>In other words, your dreams might be a random screensaver your brain turns on so it
 doesn&apos;t completely shut down.</li></ul></h3>
