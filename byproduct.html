<h1>Dreams Are a Byproduct of Mental Processing</h1>
<h2>According to the <a href="as.html">activation-synthesis model of dreaming</a>, which was first proposed by J. Allan Hobson and Robert McCarley in 1977, circuits in the brain become activated during <a href= "remsleep.html">REM sleep</a>. This process causes areas of the <a href="limbic.html">limbic system</a> involved in emotions, sensations, and memories, including the <a href= "aandh.html">amygdala and hippocampus</a>, to create an array of electrical brain impulses.
<hr>
According to this theory, the brain synthesizes and interprets this internal activity and attempts to find meaning in these signals, which we experience as dreams.
<hr>
This model suggests that dreams are a subjective interpretation of these signals generated by the brain during sleep. When we wake, our active minds pull together the various images and memory fragments of the dream to create a cohesive narrative what we call - DREAMS.
