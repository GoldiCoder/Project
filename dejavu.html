Have you ever done something that you felt you already did it?
You thought &quot;Hey I&apos;ve seen this somewhere&quot; or &quot;I&apos;ve been here before&quot;.<ul> 
<li>People regularly report that they had experienced a certain situation in a dream, which they have had a chance to experience later on in real life.</li>
<hr>
<li> That is called precognitive dreaming <a href="https://backpackerverse.com/deja-vu-dreams/">(Deja Vu)</a>.</li>
<hr>
<li>People always debate whether this is a big coincidence or if we are actually capable of sometimes seeing the future while we are dreaming.</li> 
<li>Whatever the answer is, we know that this happens occasionally to almost everyone, and it still remains the most fascinating and shocking mystery of dreams.</li>
