<li>REM Sleep is the short&ndash;form of rapid eye movement. Your first thought must have been &mdash; &quot;Why will our eyes move while we sleep,&quot; right? </li>
<hr>
To clarify that, let us dig deep, there are <a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/the-four-stages-of-sleep-2795920">four stages of sleep</a> &ndash; wake sleep (Stage 1), light sleep (Stage 2), slow wave or deep sleep (Stage 3), REM sleep (Stage 4) - And the cycle continues so.

<li>REM is the &quot;mentally restorative&quot; stage of sleep during which your brain converts short-term memories made during the day into long-term ones.</li>
<li>During this period or more correctly, waves, breathing becomes rapid and shallow. Your eyes move rapidly under your eyelids. Heart rate increases and blood pressure rises.</li>
<hr>
<li>Because of the rapidly moving eyes under our eyelids during each cycle, these periods are known as Rapid Eye Movement Sleep.</li>
<li> We usually dream during the REM stage, that is why this word pops up almost everywhere.</li>
<li>We don&apos;t fully understand REM sleep (or any of the stages, for that matter), but it seems pretty important. More on REM Sleep <a href ="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/247927" >here</a>.</li>
