<li>Psychiatrist Jie Zhang developed the Continual Activation Theory of Dreams in 2004. </li> 
<li>This theory states that during sleep, information is transferred into long-term memory. Dreams are a by-product of this data transfer process. </li>
<li>The Continual Activation theory says that dreams are caused by random memories that the brain retrieves in order to keep all parts of working memory continually active during sleep. </li>
<hr>

<li>Zhang says that dreams are stories that the brain makes up in order to make sense of random pieces of information. </li>
<li>Like Solms, Zhang says that dreams can happen during both rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, and that REM sleep itself does not cause people to have dreams.</li>
<hr>
<li> To understand more about the continual activation theory (of dreaming), it is important that we first understand the role of sleep to the human memories. </li>
