<li>The activation-synthesis model suggests that dreams are caused by the physiological processes of the brain. While people used to believe that sleeping and dreaming was a passive process, researchers now know that the brain is anything but quiet during sleep.</li>
<li>So what sort of things are happening in the sleeping brain? A wide variety of neural activity takes place as we slumber.</li>
<hr>
<li> The differences in neuronal activity of the <a href="brainstem.html">brainstem </a>during waking and <a href = "remsleep.html">REM sleep</a> were observed, and the hypothesis proposes that dreams result from brain activation during REM sleep.</li>
