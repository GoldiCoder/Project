<h1> We dream to forget</h1>
<h3> <ul> <li>There are about 10,000 trillion neural connections within the architecture of your brain. 
They are created by everything you think and everything you do.</li> 
<li>A 1983 neurobiological theory of dreaming called <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_learning">reverse learning</a>, holds that while sleeping, 
and mainly during <a href= "remsleep.html">REM sleep cycles </a>your <a href="neocortex.html">neocortex</a> reviews these neural connections and dumps the unnecessary ones. 
</li><li>Without this unlearning process, which results in your dreams, your brain could be overrun by useless connections,
 and parasitic thoughts could disrupt the necessary thinking you need to do while you&apos;re awake.</li></ul></h3>
