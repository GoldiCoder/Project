<h1> We dream to rehearse.</h1>
<h3> <ul> 
<li>Dreams involving dangerous and threatening situations are very common, 
and the primitive <a href = "irt.html">instinct rehearsal theory</a> holds that the content of a dream is significant to its purpose. </li> 
<li>Whether it&apos;s an anxiety-filled night of being chased through the woods by a <a href ="bandn.html">bear or fighting off a ninja</a> in a dark alley, 
these dreams allow you to practice your fight or flight instincts and keep them sharp and dependable in case you&apos;ll need them in real life. </li>
<li>But it doesn&apos;t always need to be unpleasant. <br> For example, dreams about talking in front of a large audience, 
will give practice to your confidence and stage fright.</li></ul></h3>
